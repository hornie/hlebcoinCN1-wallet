Release notes 1.6.0
-----
If you are coming from using the old version of the wallet, either simplewallet or GUI, you may need to clear your data directory before this wallet will work properly for you. Please be sure to backup any .wallet files in the data directory before deleting! On Windows, this directory is:
`%userprofile%\appdata\roaming\HLEBcoin`. On Mac/Linux, the directory is `~/.HLEBcoin`.

I'm too lazy to write things here. Buuuut:

CNv2 support for miner

Default pool port changed
